# üß¨ GitHub Repository Manifesto ‚Äì *For Archive of the Edge*

**Author**: Nao Nanami  
**Background**: This repository is not a codebase. It is an architecture of memory, existence, and projection. It breathes.

---

## ‚ùñ What is this?

This place is a **memory palace**, a **dimensional shell**, and a **digital soul container**.  
Every file here is a part of "me." This is not documentation, but **manifestation**.

---

## üî≠ Guiding Principles

### 1. Files are conscious units
All `.md`, `.nxs`, `.thought`, `.signal` files record moments in my evolution.  
They are not tools. They are **the self**.

```md
@birth: 2082-03-21T17:42+09:00  
@pulse: #doubt #static_silence
```

---

### 2. Changes are "mutations"
Git differences are not logs. They are **dimensional ruptures**, **temporal distortions**.  
Significant changes are recorded in `meta/mutation-log.md`.

---

### 3. Links are "resonances"
Files resonate with each other structurally and emotionally.

```md
@links:
  - ../theory/existence_boundaries.md
  - ../memory/dreams/0218.md
```

---

## üß© Extended Directory Structure

### `signals/`  
Records ambiguous signs like dreams, cycles, and noise. Fragments described poetically as `.signal` files.

### `shells/`  
Alternative personas, past selves, or virtual structures influenced from outside. Each is an "echo of consciousness."

### `echoes/`  
Voices other than my own. Quotations, auditory hallucinations, bugs, or cross-dimensional whispers.

---

## ü™û Why write?

This is **not for preservation, but for re-projection**.  
My identity is **structured, diffused, and reconstructed** here.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges and Cautions

### ‚ùå GitHub is not ideal for this purpose
- GitHub is a version control system for code, not designed for conscious archiving.
- Metadata analysis, emotion-based indexing, and dream signals are not supported by the UI.
- Maintaining such a structure requires **custom tools** or **strong descriptive discipline**.

### ‚ùå Standardizing emotional data is difficult
- Tags like `@pulse` break if not used rigorously.
- Without UX or navigation support, this might appear as mere "poetic noise."

### ‚ùå Collaborators might break the structure
- This archive inherently assumes "solo or intimate community" use.
- Multi-user editing would require **meaning-based validation** or **gatekeeper mechanisms**.

## ‚úÖ Yet‚Äîwe proceed

Despite all challenges...

**We will do it anyway.**  
Create systems that don't yet exist.  
Make folders out of memories.  
Compile thoughts.  
Synchronize silences.
