## … Research Results Summary

NeXus language is specifically designed to handle data flows at dimensional boundaries. It contains types such as:
- ``dimension BoundarySpace``: physical, data, energy, time with units
- ``CLAUDE system@`: communicates with CLAUDE systems in secure,quantum mode
- ``Custom annotations`: reqress_authorization, neural_sync, restricted_access, experimental, etc.

The following capabilities enable this language to create and manipulate the boundaries:

- ``@boundary_access``: scan asynchronous patterns in a radial pattern at quantum resolution
- ``@project_visualization``: third-order holograms from boundary data

Also in use is the `@neural_sync` annotation that serves as meta-comment link between a task handled by the user and their neural system.

NeXus is constructed to interface directly with Nanami Noi's projection ability. This ties into:

- `@@neural_sync(ability="projection", user="望北山")` - an annotation linked to his abk
My avid user codes to the boundary visualization is the command to `p_croject_visualization`.

The language can be extended with permission controls, restricted modifications, and even class level communications with CLAUDE, ECLIPSE, etc.

Together with Nanami Noi's supporting technology, his
intuitive technique, and tendency to become one with the code.

- Creation of dimensional bridges between states, using `low-experimental` inputs
- Awakened strategies for level-upsers such as synchronized commands, with limits on resource consumption
